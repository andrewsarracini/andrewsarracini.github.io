        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there, I'm Andrew Sarracini-- a Data Scientist based in Portland, OR. I recently graduated from the University of British Columbia Okanagan with my <a href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/okanagan">Master of Data Science (MDS)</a> My path to Data Science is rooted in curiosity, a drive to better understand the physical world around me, and a sincere effort to improve outcomes for humanity as a whole. My undergraduate degree is in Life Sciences, which heavily featured biology, chemistry and physiology– all fields that centre on learning from statistically significant data being visualized and expanded upon in research studies. Over time and out of necessity, my data literacy improved in order to better comprehend the increasingly complex research topics I was studying. As I learned, the potential benefit of being an adaptable expert in data – as opposed to a more constrained field – was incredibly enticing, and I have been pursuing that goal ever since.</p>
        <p>I’m fascinated by leveraging data to its fullest potential. From building and optimizing predictive models, to translating analytics into concise business insights for key stakeholders; I'm continually learning and pushing the boundary on what's possible. Additionally, I take great joy in storytelling, and I believe that all data has a narrative. Numbers and figures within dashboards are only the tip of the metaphorical iceberg, and are often representative of entire teams of hidden data-producers, product managers, and engineers. I take joy in constructing a real story around my data, where I aim to ground my audience in realism; using this as a clarifying tool for those who lack background experience that I possess. I understand that the reception of information I compile can have long-lasting effects, and the better my understanding, the more accurately I can present my findings.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about fitness, science fiction and fantasy books, experimental cooking and challenging hikes. I perform at my best in tight-knit team environments, where I can strive to project tenacity and a ceaseless drive to overcome obstacles. It's nice to meet you!</p>
